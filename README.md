# enter_the_matrix by marcelxv
I created this little front end for a web login application inspired by the release of Matrix: Ressurections. I hope you enjoy the nostalgia!
- I used a <span> animation for each letter of the email and password form label
- I used CSS to generate an animated background with the matrix letters (falling in cascade)
- I used CSS and Design to transform the style into something as close as possible to the movie's theme
